Hello 
welcome
yes we need to try some more scenarios
Export criteria are details about the Setup Task used to filter the setup data during CSV export. The export criteria are useful when the user only wants to export, and ultimately deploy, a subset of the setup data to target Oracle SaaS environment(s). Due to Oracle API limitations, only a subset of the exportable Setup Tasks support criteria functionality. It is known that some export and import processes can timeout which is likely due setup data being too large (>10MB) and/or taking too much execution time (>5 minutes). In those cases, use the Export Criteria to divide the setup data into more manageable deployment chunks.
